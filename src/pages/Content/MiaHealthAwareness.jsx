                                Mia Khalifa's brief stint in adult entertainment (2014-2015) propelled her into the global spotlight, often against her will. After leaving the industry, she began reclaiming her narrative and using her platform to advocate for various causes. Sexual health awareness became a prominent focus, surprising many due to her background.

                            <p className="mb-3">
                                Reactions to Khalifa's announcement have been divided; some have expressed doubts about her credentials and reasons for going into politics, while others have applauded her desire to interact with Indian culture outside of her former career. Political observers speculate that Khalifa's support would increase the BJP's attractiveness to some groups of people, especially young people and social media users. The party hasn't yet formally responded to Khalifa's offer of assistance, though. Mia Khalifa's surprising entry into Indian politics adds another level of fascination to the impending elections and the BJP's campaign plan as the country's political landscape continues to change. It remains to be seen if Khalifa's promise will have any real impact on the results of the elections or the larger political goal of the BJP.
